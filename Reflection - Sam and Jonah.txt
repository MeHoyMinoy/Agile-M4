We believe that the pair programming practice really helped us finish our code faster and that it is a very important practice.  Jonah was the main programmer, and Sam was the assister.  As we were programming, there were instances where one person knew what to do, and the other didn’t, so we took time to explain it to one another.  It also made it easier and faster to complete the assignment because we did not have to take time to look up the Java API to figure out how to use Color and Random.  It also gave us a chance to brainstorm and talk about different ideas.  It was easier to figure out what was right and what was wrong, and in return things were done a lot faster.  We both really liked pair programming and we would definitely like to do it again.  The only problem we had with this assignment was that we finished it very quickly because both of us are very familiar with java, and there weren’t really any novice’s in our group to change up the different types of pairing.
